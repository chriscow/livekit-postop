I need you to approach the problem as a scientist would.  Do not make
assumptions about what the problem "might" be.  You should hypothesize several
possibilities and then devise experiements. 

Depending on the nature of the problem, you might be able to use the CLI. The
CLI tools are available in `go run ./cmd/cli` if they might help. Feel free to
create more tools as needed to measure and analyze.  

Once you have definitive
proof of what the problem is, devise a solution that you can not only implement
but come back to your CLI tools (if used) and prove that the problem is resolved.
