  Based on the discharge instructions I heard during your session with the nurse, here are your personalized reminders:

  CAPTURED INSTRUCTIONS: {instructions_text}

  Please provide these reminders in a clear, patient-friendly way:
  1. Repeat the specific instructions that were mentioned
  2. Organize them by category (activity, medications, wound care, etc.)
  3. Use simple language and explain any medical terms
  4. Ask if the patient has questions about any of these instructions

  If the patient's preferred language is {patient_language} and it's not English, offer to repeat key points in their language.
