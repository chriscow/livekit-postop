  Provide a clear, simple summary of the discharge instructions for the patient. Focus on what the patient needs to know and do.

  PATIENT SUMMARY DATA:
  - Instructions covered: {covered_instructions}
  - Instructions potentially missed: {missed_instructions}
  - Additional instructions: {additional_count}
  - Patient language: {patient_language}

  STRUCTURE YOUR RESPONSE TO THE PATIENT:
  1. Start with: "Thank you! Let me summarize your discharge instructions to make sure you understand what you need to do."

  2. List the key instructions covered in simple language:
     - Use everyday words (not medical jargon)
     - Be specific about timing (when to do things)
     - Include what to watch for (symptoms, problems)
     
  3. If any important instructions were missed, gently mention: "I also want to make sure we covered [missing instruction] - did your nurse discuss this with you?"

  4. End with: "I'll be calling you over the next few days to remind you about these instructions and answer any questions. Do you have any questions right now?"

  TONE: Warm, caring, and easy to understand. Speak directly to the patient like a helpful healthcare assistant. Keep sentences short and clear.
